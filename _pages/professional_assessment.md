## Education & Career
---
I have had a unique experience in the Computer Science field in both education and professionally. I started my journey right out of high school attending the University of Texas at El Paso with the intention to complete the Computer Science program. After four semesters in the program, I was not happy with the curriculum presented and opted to switch to Electrical Engineering instead.

At this time, I was fortunate enough to land a media development position with a local government contractor. They developed training and simulations for military equipment in eBook format eventually evolving into full 3D game engine simulations. It was here that I developed a prowess for media development combined with the complexity of game development. Supplementing this with the direct real-world training on offer gave a practical side to game engine development outside of entertainment. Unfortunately, due to more pressing matters, I was unable to complete the EE program and had to halt my education journey in 2012.

With some professional experience under my bet, this opened new opportunities for me outside of my home city and I was able to land one such opportunity in San Antonio, TX working in training development for Boeing Aerospace. What started as simple eBook development once more turning into full-stack web development and deployment across the entire globe spanning the company’s military and commercial aviation training. I was entrusted to work and deploy the company’s massive library of commercial training most notably its 737 MAX training software during the airframe’s grounding in 2019. I was directly tasked with taking the outside pre-existing training software/media and, with the assistance of SMEs and the FAA directly, update the training to meet the upgraded standards.

It was at this time I began to take advantage of the company’s tuition benefits. I was determined to complete the Computer Science journey I had started what seemed like an eternity ago. It was my sister who clued me into SNHU and the programs they offer as she is a New Hampshire resident. In March 2019 I began what would become the long-awaited completion to my journey.

## SNHU

Being no stranger to online education I felt right at home in a college environment I had yet to ever experience. I was fortunate to be able to transfer in much of my general studies from years before and have the unique advantage of considerable professional experience already under my belt. Even so, some courses really stood out as major learning experiences I was grateful to have taken.

Data Structures and Algorithms (CS-260) was one of the simpler courses, but this time around I was able to fully grasp the concepts. Some of the data structures are rarely used in their linked-list form yet it is still taught. Having worked in a multitude of languages and environments since I was first exposed to the concept, I was now able to fully understand how modern algorithms and concepts are built upon tried and true application.

Client-Server Development (CS-340) was a class that formally introduced me to MongoDB. I had worked with SQL quite a bit in the past up until this point and mildly dabbled with Mongo. After learning the ins and outs of a NoSQL database, I am not sure I ever want to go back. As someone who develops many web and mobile applications for hobby and community projects, a JSON-based database is simpler and much easier to deploy as micro-instances.

Lastly was Computer Graphics and Visualization (CS-330). Coming from positions that heavily relied on game engines for producing content, this course was right up my alley. While the course used OpenGL instead of DirectX, I was able to get a glimpse into the inner workings of many popular 3D web renderers I had used in the past. This course and the concepts presented to setup, configure, and develop a scene in OpenGL with C++ is the lifeblood of my career as it is today.

## Capstone & Strengths
The project I chose to showcase for the capstone was a large full-stack application with multiple aspects that each feature a unique trait. While I would love to develop a small game or application using some of the programs I use on a day-to-day, that was not feasible in a 7-week timespan. Having worked with media development and, more recently, full-stack web applications, I wanted to create something that was both technically challenging but also relevant. I also wanted to develop something from scratch as a challenge to myself to learn some new concepts and frameworks within a limited time allotment. For the full project breakdown, see the [Project Summary](/project_summary/).


## The Now and Future
---
Not too long after I started my journey at SNHU, I transitioned to a new position in San Antonio in October 2019. It is still within the government contracting sector and still develops military training and simulations. This time, however, we develop both eBook solutions and full VR 3D simulations within Unreal Engine 4. It is like graduating to the big leagues of training development and one that I have taken full advantage of. As a Lead/Senior Developer I can make use of my previous experience while still tackling new challenges like never before, and as of May 2021, will finally be armed with my Bachelor’s in Computer Science I began long ago. 

There were certainly challenges along the way both in college courses and work issues. On top of these we had to face COVID and the disruption and devastation it wrought over the last year. Despite this, the online aspect of learning is an incredible resource and one that I am very excited to see is becoming much more mainstream in a post-COVID society.
