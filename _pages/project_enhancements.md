## Application Discord Bot
---
This artifact was chosen as part of the portfolio because it can be a strong standalone application. By itself, it has all the necessary commands and access to data to relay useful information back to the user about their in-game activities. However, as part of a larger application it becomes a useful tool in quickly accessing shared information without having to access the dashboard site.

## Application Data API
---
The artifact for this enhancement is an Express-based NodeJS API server. Its purpose is to be a one-stop shop for both the Discord bot and web dashboard to source data. This ensures the data is centrally located and both applications use and handle the same data through common accessing means.

## Application Dashboard
---
The dashboard is the practical side of the application that is user facing, outside of the Discord bot. With the local API server and database in place, this is the  practical usage of the application via web. Integrating Discord Login authentication and game user identification, stats, graphs, and histories can be viewed.
